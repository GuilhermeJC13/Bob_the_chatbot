# Bob_the_story_teller

The initial idea was to create a chatbot called Bob, but during the development, I decided to test it using a model built together with [TAIL - Technology and Artificial Intelligence League](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tailufpb/) aimed at generating horror stories.

The Hugging Face transformers library was used for the text generation model and the pygame library for the interface. In this project, I learned a lot about how transformers work (state-of-the-art of NLP), and its use in practice, both in training and for generation.
